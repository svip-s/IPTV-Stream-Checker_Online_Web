# IPTV Stream Checker (Online_Web)
A high-performance utility designed for developers and IPTV enthusiasts to audit stream assets with millisecond precision.

Features:
- Batch testing with real playback check (not just ping)
- Flags like [HTTP], [PORT], [RELAY] for instability reasons
- Dual-node comparison (server vs your browser) to spot regional blocks
- Export valid streams to M3U
- Runs in-memory, no data collection (links are useless to me)
- Browser-based, no install needed

This tool runs on Cloudflare Global IDC Nodes.

It's non-commercial, I cover costs myself. Might add minimal ads later to keep it alive.

Feedback, bugs, suggestions welcome! Thanks.
